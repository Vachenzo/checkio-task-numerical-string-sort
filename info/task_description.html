    <i>Numerical string mixed with text is commonly seen in version number, and you usually want to sort it with numerical order instead of plain text order.</i>
</p>

<p>
	If you have some files named in ["1.jpg", "2.jpg", "10.jpg", "20.jpg"], an ordinary sort will give you ["1.jpg", "10.jpg", "2.jpg", "20.jpg"],
	but usually you want to get ["1.jpg", "2.jpg", "10.jpg", "20.jpg"].
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, sometimes your filename also have non-digit characters like ["2014-5-18 09:00:00.jpg", "2014-05-19 09:00:00.jpg"], an ordinary sort will give you ["2014-05-19 09:00:00.jpg", "2014-5-18 09:00:00.jpg"], but that order is not consider "natural". The number in your filename may not be integer, eg. ["25.0411,121.6114.jpg", "25.034,121.5643.jpg"]
</p>

<p>
	For non-digit parts in filenames, an ordinary sort should be applied, you don't need to worry about non-aligned cases like: ["2.a","a.2"] as this cases usually don't have any useful result in either ways.
